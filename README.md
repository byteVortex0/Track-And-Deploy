# ðŸš€ Flutter CI/CD Training App

This project is a lightweight Flutter demo application created for hands-on practice with modern development workflows and mobile deployment automations.
There is only one screen in the app. The main purpose is not features, but learning how real production apps are built, deployed, monitored, and analyzed.
